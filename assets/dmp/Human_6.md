**Element 1: Data Type**

1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   The proposed project involves administering an additional wave of data collection for a longitudinal study. Data to be generated include social, behavioral, and biological data collected through web-surveys, in person interviews, and home health exams. Approximately 13,000 web-surveys and interviews and 200 
home health exams will be completed. 

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   From the proposed additional wave of data collection, we will share social, behavioral, and biological 
data via a tiered access plan determined by sensitivity of data as described in Element 5. 

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   Metadata will include codebooks and user guides that provide variable descriptions, survey instruments 
and descriptions of collection processes, and guidance for use. 

**Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:**  
State whether specialized tools, software, and/or code are needed to access or manipulate shared 
scientific data, and if so, provide the name(s) of the needed tool(s) and software and specify how they 
can be accessed.Data will be provided in several user-friendly formats including ASCII, SAS, SPSS, R, and Stata. We provide examples that employ basic analysis codes using two survey software packages, Stata and 
SAS.

**Element 3: Standards:**  
Codebooks will be provided in Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) format. DDI is an internationally 
recognized metadata standard for documenting survey data used by hundreds of research 
organizations. 

**Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines**

1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   Public-access data and metadata will be accessible via [Repository Name Here]. Restricted use and 
high-security restricted-use data will be provided by encrypted download through the repository virtual 
data portal. Virtual enclave-restricted data are available only through the data portal Virtual Data 
Enclave.

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   Data will be assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) and will be searchable via [Repository Name Here]
and other search engines. 

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   All data will be released by the time of publication or the end of the project period, whichever comes 
first, and will be available indefinitely through the repository websites. 

**Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations**

1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   Due to the nature of the data that will be collected, and to ensure participant confidentiality, data will be made available under a tiered system based on data sensitivity. All tiers of data require a data-use agreement at a minimum, additional precautions for restricted-use, high restricted-use, and virtual enclave data will be included in the data request forms. 

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   Public-access data will be available to researchers through the [Repository Name Here] website. 
Researchers who wish to use the most sensitive data and/or link project data to other datasets must 
apply for access through a contract request to use the [Repository Name Here] virtual data enclave. 

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   Participants will be provided a broad consent document [if allowed under IRB review] to facilitate data 
sharing. Data will be de-identified, and the tiered-access plan will provide additional protections for the 
data based upon risk assessment. The institution will determine whether the de-identified individual-level 
data are subject to the NIH Certificate of Confidentiality policy, and if so, will protect accordingly and 
ensure that recipients of the data are aware of the protection.

**Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:**  
The PI will oversee archiving and sharing of the analysis codes generated from this project upon 
publication or at the end of the project period, whichever comes first. The final project report will 
summarize adherence to this data management and sharing plan.
