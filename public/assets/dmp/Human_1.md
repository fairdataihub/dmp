**Element 1: Data Type**

1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**  
   Demographic, clinical, and MRI, 1
   H fMRS and fMRI imaging data will be acquired from 110 affected youth and
   110 matched healthy controls (described in detail in sections C.3 and C.4 of this application). All data will be deidentified prior to receipt by the repository, but the information needed to generate a global unique identifier for
   the NIMH Data Archive (NDA) will be collected for each subject.

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   Sufficient data from this project will be preserved to enable sharing via NDA data of sufficient quality to validate and replicate research findings described in the Aims. NIMH requires data measured from human subjects to be shared using the NDA.

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**  
   In addition to the subject level data described above, all 1 H fMRS and fMRI task related paradigm designs and experiment definitions will be deposited in the NDA.

**Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:**  
The clinical data will be analyzed with custom Python code written using the statsmodels, numpy, and pandas packages, all of which are freely available. H fMRS spectra will be analyzed with LCModel 6.3 software using LCMgui, which is freely available. fMRI images will be analyzed using the SPM8 toolbox for MATLAB. While MATLAB is commercial software, most universities have site licenses available and the SPM8 toolbox is free. It is also possible that the toolbox might run in Octave, an open-source alternative to MATLAB, but we have not tried it. All code will be shared on our GitHub lab website. The code can be found by searching for “labname” on GitHub. The main readme.md file for the project will also include instructions and parameter choices for the GUIbased analyses.

**Element 3: Standards:**  
Participant age, sex, ethnicity, height, weight, socioeconomic status, and other demographic data will be collected using the following instruments as defined in NDA:

1. Research Subject and Pedigree (ndar_subject01)
2. Demographics Short Form (demsf01)
3. Ethnic Group Questionnaire (ethgrp01)
4. Height and Weight (height_weight01)
5. Hollingshead Socioeconomic Rating Scale (ses01)
6. Pubertal Development Scale (pds01)
7. Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (edinburgh_hand01)
8. WASI-2 (wasi201).
   In compliance with NOT-MH-20-067, the following data will be collected to facilitate aggregation of this data set with other data sets:
9. DSM Crosscutting for Youth (dsm5crossch01)
10. RCADS-25 (rcads2501)
    The clinical assessments we plan to collect for this study include:
11. Kiddie-SADS-Present and Lifetime Version (ksads_pl01)
12. Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (cybocs01)
13. Schedule for Obsessive-Compulsive and Other Behavioral Syndromes (Hanna. Schedule for Obsessive Compulsive and Other Behavioral Syndromes, Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 2010, new data
    dictionary will be defined in NDA)
14. Dimensional Obsessive Compulsive Scale (docs01)
15. Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (yale01)
16. Child Behavior Checklist (cbcl01)
17. Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Child Parent and Self (masc_p01)
18. Conners 3 (conners3_ps01)
19. Adolescent Depression Rating Scale (doi:10.1186/1471-244X-7-2, new data dictionary will be defined in
    NDA)
    H fMRS and fMRI data will be shared with the Image (image03), Imaging Work Flow (iwf01), and Imaging
    Collection (imagingcollection01) data dictionaries as defined in NDA.

**Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines**

1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**  
   All data will be deposited to NDA starting 12 months after the award begins and will be deposited every six months thereafter following the usual NDA data submission dates.

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**  
   Data will be findable for the research community through the NDA Collection that will be established when this application is funded. For all publications, an NDA study will be created. Each of those studies is assigned a digital object identifier (DOI). This data DOI will be referenced in the publication to allow the research community easy access to the exact data used in the publication.

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**  
   The research community will have access to data when the award ends. As required by NDA, studies will also be created that contain the data used for every publication. Those studies will be shared when the pre-print is available. NDA studies have digital object identifiers (DOI) to aid in findability. We will include that DOI in relevant publications. NDA will make decisions about how long to preserve the data, but that data archive has not deleted any deposited data up to now.

**Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations**

1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   All research participants will be consented for broad data sharing.

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   To request access of the data, researchers will use the standard processes at NDA, and the NDA Data Access Committee will decide which requests to grant. The standard NDA data access process allows access for one year and is renewable.

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**  
   The NDA GUID tool allows researchers to aggregate data from the same research participant without different laboratories having to share personally identifiable information about that research participant. The NDA data dictionaries do not permit personally identifiable information to be shared. NDA maintains a Certificate of Confidentiality.

**Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:**  
The Office of Sponsored Programs at University X that will be administering this award has created a data
management and sharing plan compliance system as part of their process for submitting the annual NIH progress report. That Office is collecting information related to the number of research participants that are deposited each reporting year. The Office of Sponsored Programs will also look for the NDA data DOIs from NDA Studies and will include that information in the annual progress report.Validation Schedule (this section is required by NIMH) If funded, within 6 months of the Notice of Award date we will submit a Data Submission Agreement signed by the principal investigators and an institutional business official, as well as define and complete the Data Expected section of this project. Uploads of all initial demographic, clinical, and raw structural MRI, H fMRS and fMRI research data will be completed using the second submission cycle deadline following the Notice of Award date. Subsequent data uploads will be harmonized, validated, and submitted biannually on the standard January 15th and July 15th submission deadlines.
We also plan to use the NDA validation tool as a quality control measure in the laboratory. The data manager in charge of submitting data to NDA will help researchers in the group validate their data once every month
