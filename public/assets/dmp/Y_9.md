**Element 1: Data Type**

1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   The project will generate high-fidelity (HiFi) long-read whole-genome sequencing data from a single human HeLa cell line, obtained from ATCC. Sequencing will be performed using the PacBio platform. The expected data output is approximately 700 megabytes (MB), encompassing raw sequence reads (subreads/bam files), base-called reads (fastq files), and assembled genome data (fasta files). Associated quality metrics and summary files will also be generated.

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   All generated sequencing data — including raw HiFi reads, base-called reads, and the assembled genome — will be preserved and shared. Additionally, associated quality control metrics and summary documentation will be included. Sharing these data maximizes transparency, enables reproducibility, and provides resources for the genomics research community to further investigate complex genomic regions using long-read sequencing.

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   The following metadata and documentation will be made accessible:  
   - Sample information (source, cell line identifier, ATCC accession, passage number, extraction date, etc.)
   - Sequencing protocol and platform details (PacBio model, chemistry version, run parameters)
   - Library preparation methods and protocols
   - Data processing pipeline descriptions (software versions, parameters used)
   - Data quality control metrics (read length distributions, error rates, coverage statistics)
   - Study protocol and consent process documentation

**Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:**  
While the primary data files (fastq, bam, fasta) are standard formats accessible with open-source tools, specialized software may be needed for in-depth analysis. Examples include PacBio SMRT Link, samtools, minimap2, and IGV for visualization. These tools are freely available for academic use; download links and usage instructions will be provided in the associated documentation. Any custom scripts used for data processing will be shared via a public GitHub repository.

**Element 3: Standards:**  
Standard genomics data and metadata formats will be used to ensure interoperability:
- Sequencing data: FASTQ (base-called reads), BAM (raw reads), FASTA (assembled genome)
- Metadata: Minimum Information About a Sequencing Experiment (MINISEQE) guidelines, following the BioSample and BioProject standards used by NCBI
- Quality metrics: Standard QC files (e.g., MultiQC reports), and documentation in PDF or Markdown
All files will be named and organized according to accepted community conventions to facilitate reuse.

**Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines**

1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   All scientific data and associated metadata will be deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and GenBank, as appropriate. Metadata will be linked through NCBI BioSample and BioProject records. 

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   Scientific data will be assigned persistent unique identifiers (accession numbers) by the NCBI repositories (BioProject, BioSample, SRA, and GenBank). These identifiers will be referenced in publications and project documentation, ensuring data are discoverable via standard indexing tools such as PubMed and the NCBI search portal.

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   Data will be made available no later than the time of first publication of results or at the end of the funding period, whichever occurs first. Data will remain publicly accessible in the NCBI repositories for a minimum of 10 years from the date of deposit, in accordance with NIH and repository policies.

**Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations**

1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   All research participants (cell line donors) have been consented for broad data sharing. Because the data derive from an established and widely distributed cell line (HeLa), and do not include personally identifiable information, there are no anticipated restrictions on access, distribution, or reuse beyond those imposed by repository and NIH policies. Users will be encouraged to cite the data and acknowledge the source in any derivative work.

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   Access to the scientific data will be open and unrestricted. Data will be deposited in open-access repositories (NCBI SRA/GenBank), and no additional approval will be required for data access.

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   The data are derived from an immortalized cell line (HeLa) widely used in research and do not contain any new personally identifiable information. All data will be de-identified, and there are no direct privacy risks to individuals. The study will comply with all applicable institutional, NIH, and legal guidelines regarding the use and sharing of human-derived cell lines.

**Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:**  
Compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan will be overseen by the project’s Data Steward and the Principal Investigator (PI). The Data Steward (a designated staff member with training in data management best practices) will monitor data collection, documentation, and deposition timelines on a quarterly basis. The PI will review compliance annually and prior to major deliverables (e.g., publications, grant reporting). The Institutional Data Management Office will provide additional oversight as required by institutional policy.
