**Element 1: Data Type**

1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**  
    Type of study: Interventional, Clinical Trial. A Phase 3, Randomized, Placebo-controlled, Double-Blind
   Study of 180 mother-infant pairs in patients with early onset preeclampsia with primary outcome: days
   of maintaining pregnancy.
   360 participants (3 sites) will be enrolled in the study upon diagnosis of preeclampsia but not beyond 34
   weeks gestational age. The subjects will be followed during antepartum management and assigned to
   either the treatment or placebo groups. Infants will return for follow-up visits at 3, 6, and 12 months of
   age.
   Clinical and laboratory data
   Includes medical history, demographic information, and patient characteristics at time of enrollment.
   Other data will be extracted from each subsequent clinical encounter leading to delivery, this includes
   lab tests consistent with clinical management, physical exams (presence of headache, swelling, vision
   issues, etc), and blood pressure measurements. Fetal monitoring will include assessments of estimated
   fetal weight, and non-stress tests. Blood and urine will be collected at each visit to generate research
   laboratory data including results of urinalysis (proteinuria/creatinine ratio), analysis of angiogenic
   factors, uric acid, and glycemia. Pregnancy duration (prolongation days of pregnancy) and neonatal
   outcomes (birth weight, Apgar scores, head and chest circumference at birth, short term prognosis of
   neonate, NICU admission) will also be recorded.
   Infant follow-up studies will include anthropometric measurements, and neurodevelopment
   assessments such as the Bayley scale of infant development at 3, 6, and 12 months.
   These values will be reported as tabular data and stored in a REDCap secure electronic data capture
   system.
   Clinical imaging
   2D images generated from Doppler studies of uterine, umbilical and middle cerebral arteries will be
   collected and deidentified raw images will be stored as .jpeg files. The presence of uterine artery
   notching will also be recorded. The pulsatility index for each image will be extracted as tabular data and
   stored in .csv files.
   3D images of the fetal thigh will be obtained and stored as deidentified .vol files. These images will then
   be used to measure total thigh, lean mass, and subcutaneous fat volumes. Volume measurement will
   be stored in .csv files.
   Real-time grayscale 2D clips of the fetal heart will be acquired to measure global sphericity and cardiac
   area percentile. Deidentified DICOM files of raw data and .csv files of cardiac measurements and
   percentiles will be stored.

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
    All subject-level clinical, laboratory, and clinical imaging data described in 1A will be preserved and
   shared. Shared data, including ultrasound images, will be deidentified, and original data will be
   maintained at the investigator’s institution.
   Recruitment progress and final results will be documented at clinicaltrials.gov.

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**  
    Protocols, informed consent forms to participate in the trial and for biological sample collection, data
   dictionary, and code book will be shared with the data through the repositories. For data submitted to
   DASH, variable-level metadata will be provided using the DASH Codebook, which is a templated data
   dictionary, and will include details of Common Data Elements, definitions, and standards used for data
   collection and sharing. For data submitted to MIDRC, the data will be mapped to the Medical Imaging
   and Data Resource Center Commons dictionary. Other study-associated documentation including
   image acquisition parameters and image analysis workflow diagrams will also be submitted to MIDRC
   as supplementary files associated with the study to facilitate interpretation of the scientific data.

**Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:**  
Clinical and laboratory data will be collected in the electronic data capture system (REDCap) and
analyzed using open-source statistical software packages. R software will be used for statistical
analyses and graphics.
Doppler examinations will be performed using RM6C matrix 4D convex probe (Voluson E10, GE
Healthcare) and V4-8 4D convex probe (Medison V20 Prestige, Korea) with the high-pass filter at
60 Hz. Spectral Doppler analysis of flow velocity waveforms in uterine and fetal blood vessels will be
performed on the ultrasound machine (Voluson E10).
For imaging, 2D .jpeg images will be directly exported from either the ultrasound machine or EMR
image storage. 3D volumetric assessment will be performed with the 4DView 7.0 licensed software
(Voluson, GE Healthcare). Analysis of real-time cardiac clips will be performed using the open source
DICOM viewer ITK-SNAP, an application supported by Insight toolkits (Kitware Inc., Clifton Park, NY,
USA).

**Element 3: Standards:**  
Raw data will be standardized to CDISC (Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium) format
whenever possible. Medical laboratory data will be standardized using LOINC whenever possible.
This research project will use relevant Common Data Elements from the NIH Common Data Elements
Repository for data collection and relevant Medical Imaging and Data Resource Center (MIDRC)
Commons dictionary for imaging data.
File formats for each data type are described in Element 1A.

**Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines**

1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**  
   DASH (clinical and laboratory data) Medical Imaging and Data Resource Center (MIDRC) (clinical imaging)

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**  
    DASH creates a DOI for each study. We will submit a request to MIDRC to create a persistent identifier
   for the study and will list the other study persistent identifier on the repository study pages. Potential new users from other organizations can find out about our data and identify whether it could
   be suitable for their research purposes through summary information (metadata) that will be readily
   available on our study website, the repository websites, and clinicaltrials.gov.

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**  
    Baseline data (defined as any data collected prior to any intervention), such as demographics, tabular
   clinical data (i.e. blood and urine tests), and images that require no additional analyses will be
   submitted within 4 months after enrollment is completed and released through the repositories 4
   months after that.
   After the study is complete and unblinded, the study team will submit all remaining scientific data to the
   data repositories (DASH and MIDRC) and will update the RCT status to “complete” in clinicaltrials.gov.
   According to the proposed project timeline, the release of the remaining scientific data will
   approximately coincide with the submission of final results to clinicaltrials.gov, as mandated by FDAAA,
   and will occur by the end of award or publication, whichever comes sooner.
   Under the current repository policies, data will be preserved and available for the wider research
   community in perpetuity.

**Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations**

1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   Data will be shared as allowed by the informed consents and institutional certification.

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
    Clinical and laboratory data will be shared with controlled access in DASH for general research use.
   Deidentified data shared with MIDRC will be available via registered access.

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**  
    For a prospective study like this one, consent procedures will include provision for data sharing to
   maximize the value of the data for wider research use, while providing adequate safeguards for
   participants. As part of the consent process, proposed procedures for data sharing will be set out
   clearly and current and potential future risks associated with this will be explained to research
   participants.
   Language informing the participant or legally authorized representative that residual biological
   specimens may be stored in a biorepository for other scientific investigations will be used in the consent
   forms. The informed consents will contain language permitting secondary use with broad data sharing
   under controlled access for general research use through established data repositories such as DASH
   (clinical and laboratory data) and MIDRC (imaging). Patients will be informed that they will not be
   contacted or re-consented for future sharing or accessing data through repositories.
   Privacy and confidentiality protections will be consistent with applicable federal, Tribal, state, and local
   laws, regulations, and policies.
   As the data is collected it will be digitally preserved in our secure institutional cloud storage
   environment and the PI’s computer under strict password access. As this research data includes
   personal data relating to human participants, special measures will be followed to safeguard the
   security of data. We will follow robust policies for managing confidentiality and data security, consistent
   with legal, good practice and NIH policy requirements. This study will be compliant with ISO 27001 IT
   security standards. Our institution is ISO compliant (registration number 2374573.)
   Data will be deidentified before sharing in DASH and MIDRC by removing all 18 direct identifiers
   according to HIPAA Privacy Rule’s Safe Harbor.

**Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:**  
The contact PI for the project is Dr. Responsible at University of Pregnancy. Dr. Responsible will meet
monthly with members of the project team, Dr. Doppler (University of City, clinical imaging data
collection), Mr. Organized (University of Pregnancy, data manager), and Dr. Laboratory (University of
State, processing of laboratory samples) to ensure that data collection, management and submission to
repositories are compliant with this DMS Plan. Progress on this Plan will be communicated annually in
the RPPR.
