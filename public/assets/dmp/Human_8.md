**Element 1: Data Type**

1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**  
   This project is estimated to generate: (i) 30 Compound A analogâ€™s design, production, characterization, and purification protocols. (ii) in vitro and cell-based assays of Compound A analogs (30 compounds to be tested). (iii) Substance stability and in vitro and in vivo toxicology (10 compounds, 6 WT mice per dose, 5 doses), (iv) Pharmacokinetics (ADME) (3-4 compounds to be tested, 10 5xFAD mice per dose, 4 doses). (v) Preclinical positron emission tomography (PET) imaging data (2-3 compounds, 15 WT or 5xFAD mice per compound).

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
    The scientific data types mentioned above will be shared with protocols and metadata according to
   repository requirements so that they can be reproduced by other researchers and/or generate new
   hypotheses. Types of files that will be generated include, but will not be limited to, _.docs, _.xls, _.pdf, _.cdx, \*.mol). Specifically, chemical structures, synthesis workflow, and analytical chemistry will be uploaded as PDF files. Medicinal and analytical chemistry measurements will be processed and shared on
   spreadsheets and as graphs. For histopathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) experiments, we will
   preserve images and process and summarize the data on spreadsheets and graphs. PET imaging will be
   shared as PET/CT images.

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**  
    In addition to the subject-level data described above, all the data related to Compound A design,
   PK/toxicology, assay development, probe chemistry, and in vivo PET imaging, along with related paradigm
   design and experimental definitions will be included when data are deposited in their respective
   repositories. For example, quality control measurements and protocols, standard curves, instrument
   calibration protocols, names of equipment used (to be included in protocols), and list of reagents, including
   catalog number and provider, especially to reproduce the synthesis of compound A analogs will be shared.

**Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:**  
We will generate and use our own codes written on the MATLAB software. These codes will assist with the
quantitative data analysis of IHC images. PET/CT images will be processed with the Amide (Sourceforge).
Medicinal and analytical chemistry will be processed with EZChrom Elite (OpenLabs). Graphs will be
generated with Prism (GraphPad). Chemical structures will be generated with Chemfinder (PerkinElmer).
MATLAB, EZChrom Elite, Prism, and Chemfinder are commercially available software. Amide software is
available for free.

**Element 3: Standards:**  
All preclinical efficacy testing studies will be conducted and reported in compliance with NIH guidance on
rigor and reproducibility. Particularly, the preclinical efficacy studies will follow the general ARRIVE
guidelines for animal research and the best practice guidelines for AD preclinical efficacy studies.

**Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines**

1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**  
    Compound A analogs design, production, characterization, and purification protocols will be deposited in
   PubChem (analogs and physicochemical characteristics) and at the AD Knowledge Portal. Data generated
   from Compound A analogs in vitro and in vivo cell-based assays, PK and toxicology assays, and preclinical
   PET imaging will be deposited at the AD Knowledge Portal. Codes for the quantitative data analysis of IHC
   images will be deposited at the AD Knowledge Portal.

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**  
    The reported data will be findable and identifiable using PMID or DOI identification numbers. The AD
   Knowledge Portal has its own IDs and metadata to allow for data and projects to be searchable and
   identifiable. This data DOI will be referenced in the publication to allow the research community easy
   access to the exact data used in the publication. The PMID or DOI identification numbers will also be
   posted on the lab website.

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**  
    The research community will have access to data at publication or at the end of the award, whichever
   comes first. AD Knowledge portal standard submission deadlines will be taken into consideration to comply
   with the DMS timeline requirements. Studies will be uploaded to the AD Knowledge Portal prior to
   publication to include their own digital object identifiers (DOI) to aid in findability. We will include that DOI in
   the relevant publications. The AD Knowledge Portal will make decisions about how long to preserve the
   data. This repository has not deleted any deposited data as far as we know.

**Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations**

1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
    If we have an invention for which we intend to seek patent protection, we may request approval to delay
   the sharing of scientific data associated with it until a patent is filed and will update this Plan to reflect any
   approved delays in data sharing beyond expected data sharing timelines. We anticipate that if intellectual
   property is generated, it would be on the methods of synthesis of Compound A analogs and chemical
   structures. To maximize data sharing, we will share the physical properties and use of the Compound A
   analogs, including binding specificity, Kd values, and imaging data without delay.

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   Scientific data and metadata will be distributed as open access at the AD Knowledge Portal since it is non human data.

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**  
   Not applicable since this project involves only preclinical animal models.

**Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:**  
Prof. Smith (principal investigator (PI)) will be responsible for all aspects of data management and sharing, including collecting, analyzing, and describing the data. Prof. Smith will monitor adherence to NIH DMS and upload data to the AD Knowledge Portal and other repositories. The PI will validate/curate data once a month.
